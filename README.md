# OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) Projects
This is a repo for moving forward a variety of projects within the OpenAPI community. In an effort to be more transparent and help involve the community in a variety of ways we will be managing most projects within this repository. This README should provide you with everything you need to get started working on an existing project, or suggest a new project.

## How It All Works
We are just getting started with this effort to external project work, so this process will evolve. Here are the moving parts for managing projects using this repository:

- **README** - The README is the "home page" for all the project being managed and will be kept as an overview of everything that is happening.
- **Issues** - We are using issues for the catch all basket for any comments, questions, or feedback, and projects can have multiple issues.
- **Projects** - Once an idea or suggestion for a new project is set into motion it will be given a formal project for managing all tasks.
- **Pages** - Ongoing projects may also have a dedicated markdown page that provides access to any related documents and artifacts.
- **Folder** - Projects may also be able to have their own folders within the repository for organizing any code or related artifacts.

Feel free to suggest a new project by submitting an issue, or roll up your sleeves and get involved in a specific project by jumping in on the issues or the discussions for each area of work.
